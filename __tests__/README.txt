Our E-commerce Project
This is my school project - an online store built with Next.js where you can browse products and add them to a shopping cart.

What it does:

Shows different products like backpacks, shoes, t-shirts, hoodies, etc.
You can add/remove items from your cart
Has a checkout page with a form to "buy" stuff
Works on mobile and desktop

What I used to build it

Next.js (React framework)
Tailwind for styling
React Context for managing the cart state
TypeScript for better code
Jest and React Testing Library for tests
